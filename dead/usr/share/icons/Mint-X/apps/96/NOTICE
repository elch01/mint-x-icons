Only use this directory for icons that relate to dead projects for example corebird (a twitter client that stopped working when twitter disabled 3rd part client use)

NOTE: NOT projects that dont have any development, just applications that are literally unusuable.
No need to bloat the icon pack with icons for applications that dont work anymore.
